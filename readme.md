## Installation

### From latest release (recommended)

- Find the latest suitable release of BlendLuxCrore on the release page:  
https://github.com/LuxCoreRender/BlendLuxCore/releases
- Note: the release labelled "Latest" is a nightly build and may be particularly unstable even compared to alpha or beta release versions!
- From the release assets, download extension `BlendLuxCore-*.zip`
- Open Blender and follow "Install from disk" procedure (https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/preferences/extensions.html)

Beforehand, you may want to uninstall previous version of BlendLuxCore: look in the "Get Extensions" panel.

See also https://wiki.luxcorerender.org/BlendLuxCore_Installation for a more detailed guide.

### Building locally from source

**Note: It is recommended to build the extension using GitHub Actions in a local fork!**

Prerequisites: you need `cmake` and `blender` installed and in your `PATH`

Build extension:
- clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/LuxCoreRender/BlendLuxCore.git`
- configure: `cmake -S BlendLuxCore -B blc-build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`
- build: `cmake --build blc-build`

To create a `Latest` release, use the option `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Latest` in the step `configure`.

The build script then places the collected zip-file in the `blc-build` subfolder.

Open Blender and follow "Install from disk" procedure (https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/preferences/extensions.html)

Beforehand, you may want to uninstall previous version of BlendLuxCore: look in the "Get Extensions" panel.
